This winter I spent a week in the Cairngorms doing my first ever winter climbing.
It was great fun and I would totally recommend it to anyone who rock climbs.

##Reviews##
I tried out a lot of new gear, so I've written some micro-reviews.

###[Rab Generator Pull-on](http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/synthetic-fill/generator-pull-on.html)###
This didn't see much use, the temperature was quite mild (for Scottish winter), I put it on a few times and it kept me very cozy.
It's a nice light synthetic jacket, I favour pull-ons as they minimize weight and heat loss.

###[Rab Demand Pull-on](http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/shell/demand-pull-on.html)###
I love this shell. It has a minimal design, a deep half zip, one chest pocket, made from eVent, and a great hood.
It's everything I want in a shell.

###[Rab Baseline Hoodie](http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/baselayer/baseline-hoodie.html)###
Another item I love from Rab, the power dry material is really comfortable and wicks incredibly well.
The hood is great for the cold and wind, though it can't be worn fully zipped with a helmet; it would also be more comfortable if the zip was to one side like the Patagonia R1 hood.

###[Mountain Hardwear Scrambler ULT 30](http://www.mountainhardwear.co.uk/Scrambler%E2%84%A2-ULT-30/OU4530,default,pd.html)###
I found out that 30L is a bit small for winter climbing, a 35-40L bag would have been more appropriate.
Despite that, this bag is great. It's incredibly light at only 475g (advertised as 400g, I wish given weights were more realistic).
This weight is achieved through minimal padding, a minimal frame, and 100D nylon material.
The padding and frame were fine, as I was always wearing a fair amount of clothing; I wonder if it will be comfortable enough in the summer.
There isn't any noticeable wear yet in the material, it will be interesting to see how long it lasts.

###[Extremities Super Inferno Glove](http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/clothing-accessories/all-gloves-mitts/super-inferno-glove/)###
I didn't really know what I needed in terms of gloves, I erred on the side of caution and went with a very warm pair.
In hindsight I would have been better off with the Inferno gloves. The Super Inferno was too warm and lacked dexterity that would have been useful.

###[Extremities Super Inferno Mitt](http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/clothing-accessories/all-gloves-mitts/super-inferno-mitt/)###
These didn't see any use at all. As with the Super Inferno gloves I should have gotten the Inferno mitts.

###[Extremities Windy Lite Dry Gloves](http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/clothing-accessories/all-gloves-mitts/windy-lite-dry-glove/)###
I wear these all the time for walking and cycling they offer great protection for very little weight. Only the backs are windproof which gives a good mix of breathability and protection.
They are getting quite worn now after about a year of use.

###[Extremities Super Windy Beanie](http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/clothing-accessories/all-hats-caps-headwear/super-windy-beanie/)###
Really warm and comfortable hat, can't fault it.
