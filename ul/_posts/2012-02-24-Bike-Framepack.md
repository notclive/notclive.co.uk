I've been seeing posts about fatbiking on a lot of ultralight blogs (especially [bedrockandparadox.com](http://bedrockandparadox.com/) check it out). What caught my attention most was the packs they where using. Instead of the traditional panniers, which I find makes everything a bit wobbly, they have packs that attach under the seat, to the handlebars and inside the frame; using every spare bit of space.

I really liked the look of [porcelain rocket's packs](http://www.porcelainrocket.com/), so I made my own framepack with a similar style. The pack is made from X-Pac VX21, I would have used the lighter VX07 but it wasn't available at the time. The volume is around 5L which is enough for a bike lock, tools and some low volume clothing. The only design mistake I made was not to put the velcro attachments on the corners, whenever I pull on the zip the corner of the pack moves because there is nothing holding it in place.
