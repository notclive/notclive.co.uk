I finally got my hands on some cuben fiber and made a 15l pack out of it. The size is great for day to day use (cycling to uni etc.), and I really like the slim profile. The design is as simple as possible, simply a rectangle with a roll top. There is no 'back system' I just insert a rectangle of foam in the back. The pack itself weighs 90g and the foam pad 30g, totalling 120g, I can barely tell I'm wearing it when it's empty.

I tried making the pack sew-free and waterproof by taping all the seams. The tape started peeling so I backed up the seams with stitching, the cuben doesn't seem to be completely waterproof anyway (though close enough). I didn't put any padding in the straps, to compensate for this I made the straps very wide (8cm). This worked well, I've never felt discomfort even when carrying about 4kg. But the part of the strap lower down, where it goes under the shoulder, has bunched up into a tapered shape; I will try and mimic this shape with my next pack.

I generally wear this pack when cycling, as expected my back can get very sweaty. I plan on trying to make some kind of suspended back system, where only mesh is in contact with my back. I will also make the pack taller, the extra space will be useful occasionally and the increase in weight will be small.
