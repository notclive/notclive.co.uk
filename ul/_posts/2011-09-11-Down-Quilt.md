I've just finished making a new down quilt. I was previously using a MYOG half quilt along with a down jacket, this setup wasn't great. It wasn't very light, this new quilt saves me around 300g, down jackets aren't very weight efficient for sleeping because a lot of the down is crushed. The old quilt was a little too small, so it was a bit drafty. It also wasn't very comfortable to sleep in a down jacket.

The shell weighs around 200g and is made of [44g/sqm nylon](http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/Ripstop-Nylon-impregnated-inner-tent-44-g-sqm::463.html) and [17g/sqm mosquito netting](http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/Mosquito-Net-polyamide-140-mesh-qcm-17g-sqm-superultralight::1565.html) for the baffles, the nylon isn't described as down-proof but seems to be all right so far (edit: I would not use this nylon again with down, it leaks a lot of down). The fill is 260g of 900/850 fill power down. This gives a total weight of 460g. I could go lighter by using a lighter shell material but wanted to keep costs down, I hope to remake it sometime with a lighter nylon.

The quilt is 180cm long, 130cm wide tapering to 85cm. I made the quilt smaller than most do, it seems to be just big enough. It is baffled with 12 5cm deep and 15cm long baffles.
