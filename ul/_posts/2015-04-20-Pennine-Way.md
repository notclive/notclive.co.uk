Last weekend I hiked for three days along the Pennine Way from Edale to Hebden Bridge.
I met with some friends who live locally for part of the route, which was nice as I typically travel solo.

The distance of my planned route was a bit short.
I could have covered much more distance, but I was limited as I had already bought a train ticket for the return journey.
Next time I think I will increase the planned distance to around 30km a day.

As with the South Downs Way navigation was a bit plain, on the positive side this enables me to cover greater distances. Not every trip needs to be an exercise in navigation.

The temperature was very warm for April in the UK.
Due to the warm forecast I didn't carry a midlayer, relying on my wind shirt and rain jacket for layering.
At one point the wind shirt and rain jacket didn't offer enough protection so I wore my down jacket for one cold windy section, this ended up being a bit too warm.

The first night was cold, not so bad that I couldn't get to sleep, but my sleep was quite patchy.
This was due to my shelter being pitched in such a way that it was very drafty.
My second night was much warmer due to a better pitch and a more sheltered location.

[My base pack weight was 4.4kg](http://lighterpack.com/r/bywfoa), with the pack approaching 10kg total weight with full food and water.
I was using the Mountain Hardwear Scrambler ULT which is a 30L pack, I feel like 10kg is near the limit of the weight this pack can hold comfortably.
The weight felt very good, while I will continue to reduce my pack weight, I feel I've reached a comfortable three season weight.

The current easiest place for me to reduce weight will be by looking at the food I carry.
Firstly, I can simply carry less food and rely on eating at cafes, pubs or resupplying at shops.
Secondly, I can pay attention to the caloric density of the food I'm packing.
Currently most of my calories come from cooked meals, which I estimate have around 200-300 calories per 100 grams.
Whereas 100 grams of cashews, for example, contain over 600 calories. I can drastically reduce my food weight by carrying more calorie dense food.
Whilst it's nice to stop and have a warm cooked meal, not every meal needs to be cooked, and cooked meals don't need to be my biggest source of calories.

My shelter currently makes a lot of noise in high wind, placing some guy lines in the middle of the shelter wall would reduce the noise and increase the amount of space inside during windy conditions.
On previous trips my hiking pole has spent most of its time attached to my pack, but on this trip I used it for its intented purpose, as a walking pole, because I was starting to develop knee pain. It worked very well and my knee didn't get any worse once I started using it.

My shoes gave me sore feet, not so painful that I couldn't continue walking but unpleasant.
Perhaps wearing such light shoes is a mistake, perhaps my feet simply aren't used to it.
I will continue experimenting with my lightweight shoes and spend more time walking in between trips.

For my next trip I would like to experiment with shoulder mounted water bottles. This moves weight forward, making things more balanced. It also makes my water more accessible, and makes more room in my pack. I would mount a 500ml water bottle on each shoulder. The only problem is treatment as I currently use chlorine dioxide tablets which treat 1 litre per tablet.
