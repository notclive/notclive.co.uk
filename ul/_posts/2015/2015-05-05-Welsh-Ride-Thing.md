My first experience of the Welsh Ride Thing was a drizzly, chilly, field, with a few people standing around. I had arrived early having caught the train the night before and camped nearby. Slowly more and more people started to arrive, bringing with them all sorts of weird and wonderful bikepacking setups.
The set-off was every bit as unceremonious as I hoped it would be, and somehow this added to the apprehension and excitement as I pedaled off.

After the [South Downs Way]({% post_url 2015/2015-03-30-Bikepacking-South-Downs-Way %}) I bought some Salsa Anything Cages to move weight towards the front of the bike.
Whilst this worked and my front wheel didn't lift on steep uphills, the cages caused worse problems. I packed them with Exped UL drybags, these bags are made from a very thin silnylon, which allowed the contents of my drybags to deform and slip under the straps. On two occasions my drybags slipped out of the cages and went into my front wheel, splitting a food bag on one occasion.
I will be getting a frame bag instead for the next trip, hopefully this will provide enough capacity to carry everything I need without the cages.

I wasn't really sure what distance I would be able to cover in the time available. I planned a vague route by joining the provided checkpoints with roads and bridleways. I didn't end up covering very much of the planned route, what I did end up doing was a lot of grueling hike a bike, often over boggy hills.
The route I chose wasn't very practical, not all bridleways can be travelled by bike, some of the paths I planned to travel weren't anything more than slightly muddier variants of the surrounding terrain, and due to the rain everything was even boggier than usual.
I also ended up hiking due to navigational mistakes, I was navigating with 1:50,000 printed maps and a compass. Most participants used GPS, which I think is necessary for me to move quickly in tough to navigate terrain. It also didn't help my navigation that my compass stopped pointing north at sometime during the event!

A major event of the Welsh Ride Thing is the weigh in, where everyones bike and kit gets weighed in competition to be crowned the lightest.
My kit came in at 21kg, which is what I was expecting [based on my kit list](http://lighterpack.com/r/c5wdfw). This was split roughly into 14.5kg for the bike, 2.5kg of food, and 4kg for everything else. My pack weight was higher than 4kg as I was wearing a lot of clothing during the weigh in.
The lightest weight achieved was around the same weight as my bike alone. This is where most of my weight savings will come from, while I can reduce some weight from my packed weight, there is a lot more potential to reduce weight from the bike.

Following on from my review of the [Pennine Way trip]({% post_url 2015/2015-03-30-Bikepacking-South-Downs-Way %}) I reduced the amount of food carried. I reduced the number of cooked meals, and brought more calorie dense snacks instead. I bought food whenever I passed a shop and stopped for a pub lunch on Sunday afternoon. This worked really well, I didn't go hungry and even had food left over at the end.

Initially, I imagined that I might set off and then not see any other riders until the end. This wasn't true I kept crossing paths with other riders, this was nice as it can get lonely going solo for days on end.
I will definitely be back for next years ride. The atmosphere was great, everyone was enthusiastic and really nice. And there really was as much cake as I could eat at the finish!
