I didn’t have a real goal for this trip I just wanted to go and do some hiking. I ended up hiking about 92km and getting 15 peaks above 2000m. Regrettably I forgot to bring a camera on this trip so have no photos.

I made changes to my gear based on my hike in Snowdonia, so I was testing new gear yet again. I added a pertex top to my groundsheet to make a windproof/water-resistant bivy bag, this kept me a lot warmer as draughts couldn’t get through my quilt. In the longer term I will make a new bigger quilt probably making it full size and only using my down jacket in the winter.

Trip Report
-----------

###Day 1 (35.24 km)####

I got the bus to Merthyr Tydfil arriving at 10am and followed the Taff Trail to get to the Beacons. It was a really nice morning, I spent most of the morning off tracks getting to Cefn yr Ystrad and then down onto the Beacons Way. Once I was on the Beacons Way, I was moving very quickly, I followed it over all the peaks heading west. The weather declined slightly with showers and strong winds, I think this area always has strong winds. I started thinking about where I would camp as I was walking down from Pen y Fan, I decided I would summit Fan Fawr first then camp. I got to Fan Fawr and left my pack where I would camp and go up to the top quickly and unburdened. It started raining just as I was pitching my tarp, I pitched it as quite a low lean-to. The wind and rain picked up as I tried to go to sleep, the rain was pretty horizontal so the tarp wasn’t doing a great job of keeping me dry. I begrudgingly got out of my bivy bag and re-pitched the tarp as a very low A-frame. This was better, I was still getting some rain on me, but the bivi bag was keeping me dry enough.

###Day 2  (32.19 km)###

When I woke up it was foggy and still raining lightly. I followed a bearing to get me onto the Beacons Way again, then lost the trail near Craig Cwm-Du, then found it again around Fan Dringarth and Fan Lila, then lost it again as I came down into the valley. I had lunch here and the fog lifted off the hills around me and the rain eased off. As the Beacons Way continued on the Sarn Helen which I’d walked before and isn’t that exciting I decided to go off trails again and bag a few peaks. It was starting to get late as I came down into the next valley, so I was rushing to get back up into the mountains to camp. I found a nice spot up on the lower part of Fan Hir. It was a generally dry night, which let me dry out my clothing; I managed to get my wet socks dry by stuffing them in my down jacket pockets.

###Day 3 (24.84 km)###

I new I could get a bus back from Dan yr Ogof the next day so I decided to loop around and finish the day to camp above Dan yr Ogof. I continued along Fan Hir, popped down to Llyn y Fan Fawr then followed the Beacons Way again for a few hours. When I got to Carreg Las I went off east to join with a path that lead to Dan yr Ogof, I found the path but then it abruptly disappeared and I went in the wrong direction. I reached a river and took my compass off my neck to orient the map, I decided to take my bag off. In the process of removing my bag I managed to fling my compass somewhere. I panicked. I was running around looking for it, checking the river and rummaging between clumps of moss. It was right by where I was standing when I dropped it, panic over. I decided I needed to follow the river up and came to the ford I was looking for, the path was pretty obvious from here on. I found a sheltered dip to pitch my tarp, it turns out it was too sheltered the lack of wind caused a large amount of condensation which was rubbing off onto my sleeping bag. I will pick a slightly windy spot in future and not pitch my tarp so low when it isn’t raining.

###Day 4###

It was a short walk down to Dan yr Ogof in the morning where I caught the bus back home.

Gear
----

[My gear list](http://www.geargrams.com/list?id=3990). My base weight was just under 10lbs so classes as ultralight. I was carrying about 3kg food for 3+ days, this was definitely too much, I will cut back on food a lot next trip. I brought my Kindle eBook reader, I barely spent any time reading it, I will definitely not bring it next time. I would like to make a new tarp with beaks to stop sideways rain, I would use this with just a bug bivy on the inside.
