I've been envious of bikepackers for some time. It looked like the perfect combination of adventure, technical gear, self reliance, and the outdoors.
When I purchased a mountain bike last January it was inevitable that I would take to the hills on it.
For my first trip I rode the South Downs Way; a 160km long national trail running across the South Downs National Park.

I set off from London by train on a clear Friday evening. I arrived after dark and with some solid navigation guesswork I made my way through Winchester to the start of the South Downs Way. I soon discovered that riding at night was incredible fun, I made a plan to do more the following night. I rode for around an hour and picked what seemed like a decent bivvy spot just off the way.

I chose to use a bivvy bag on this trip for a few reasons. Firstly, stealth, I was wild camping and the South Downs aren't very remote. Secondly, simplicity, bivvying is just easier. Thirdly, my current shelter relies on a hiking pole, which I didn't want to carry with me; I have since purchased a pole for my shelter. I've found that bivvying doesn't work if there is more than light rain, I had looked at the forecast and knew that it was unlikely that there would be any rain.

The route turned out to be far hillier than I expected. I hadn't payed much attention to descriptions of the route beforehand, or looked at any height profiles, and the name South *Downs* didn't tip me off. The South Downs Way is constantly undulating, over 3,500m of ascent in total. I actually quite enjoyed the hills, there is no monotony, but a perpetual fluctuation between intense effort on the climb and exhilarating descent.

Before the trip I thought I had packed too much food. I was carrying just over 1kg of food per day. This turned out not to be enough food, I ended up taking a detour to buy some extra food; I have never eaten a bar of chocolate so quickly. My meals were large enough but I should have brought more snacks.

I could have reduced the weight I carried by refilling water more often. There are plenty of water points along the trail, and I ended up carrying a lot of water that I didn't need. On the other hand, the water sources weren't completely reliable, one tap wasn't running and I couldn't find another. If I was somewhere with more reliable water sources, i.e. rivers, I would plan my water refills better to minimize carried weight.

I felt like I slowed down a lot on the last day. But based on GPS data my average speed was similar to Day 2, and I wasn't taking considerably more breaks.

I started to develop knee pain, towards the very end. It's very easy to overdo it on the bike, you have the same number of daylight hours as you do on foot but are exerting a lot more effort. I will make sure to pace myself better next time, giving myself more time to cover a similar distance.

In retrospect the South Downs Way was an excellent introduction to bikepacking. The navigation was easy as the trail was very well sign posted, the only value my map offered me was a measure of progress. I was also very fortunate with good weather and good terrain. Had it been a wet weekend I would have been much worse off, and possibly wouldn't have completed the trail.

[My gear list](http://lighterpack.com/r/9isilh).

My base weight was 6.1kg which is heavier than my usual walking weight because of the additional bags and bike tools. There is still some fine tuning of gear to be done, as always. I would like to remove most of the weight from my back, by only carrying a small hydration pack. I will also try to move some weight towards the front of my bike using a larger handlebar bag or some Salsa Anything Cages.

I will definitely be back for more bikepacking, I am already preparing for the [Welsh Ride Thing](http://bearbonesbikepacking.co.uk/WelshRideThing/) in May.
