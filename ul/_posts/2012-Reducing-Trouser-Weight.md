Inspired by [a post on the backpacking light forum](http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/forums/thread_display.html?forum_thread_id=49558), where Bryce F reduces the weight of his trousers by removing the back pockets, I decided to take this idea to the extreme and see how much weight I could lose from my trousers.

The trousers I've modified are a pair of Columbia Titanium trousers which weighed 291g (10.3 ounces) without modification (I had already removed the label, like any respectable ultralighter).

The first step I took was to remove the back pockets, back pockets are pretty useless anyway, you can't sit down and use them at the same time. Removal of the pockets reduced the weight by 18g, thats a 6% weight reduction. Not bad but I figured I could do more.

Remove cargo pockets

Remove side pockets

Remove belt loops

Remove zip covers

Remove waist inner

Remove zip pulls
