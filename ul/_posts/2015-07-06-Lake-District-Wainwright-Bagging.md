The goal for my recent trip to the lake district was to summit as many Wainwrights as I could over three days and three nights.
I managed to climb 36 summits in total, 28 of which were Wainwrights.

The weather was very good in general, apart from a morning of thunder, low clouds and torrential rain on Saturday. I'll admit I considered quitting at the thought of spending a whole day in such weather. I persevered and the weather soon subsided.

The lake district remains my favourite place to hike, it provides the right mix of accessibility and remote mountainous terrain.

## The Route

The route was quite difficult to navigate in places especially when submerged in cloud. The lesser visited summits had no obvious paths to the top, so good map and compass skills were critical. I am now very comfortable going cross country off the worn trails, but I still forget how much this reduces the pace.

## My Gear

[I pared down my base pack weight to 3.5kg](http://lighterpack.com/r/1plnqv), this was a very comfortable weight to carry. The next area to reduce weight in is my stove, I am going to experiment with not cooking on shorter trips and using an alcohol stove on longer trips.

On Friday night I pitched my shelter on the top of a ridge a little while on from Glaramara. The turbulent wind that rose from the valley caused the walls of my shelter to flap vigorously. This meant I couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep without being hit by the walls of my shelter. After a few hours of failing to sleep I gave up and packed my shelter away, I then awoke to rain at 6am which made my quilt damp.

A bigger shelter would have helped as I could have found a comfortable position. I still would have had to sleep through the noise of my tent in the strong winds, better selection of sleeping spot is needed in the future.

I wore shorts over a synthetic baselayer which let me adjust my layers based on the temperature. The problem I had was that I had to take my shorts off to put my leggings on, which wasn't ideal in the pouring rain. I will try leg warmers on my next trip as these can be put on and removed without taking off my shorts.

I was comfortable with the clothes I brought but I would bring a light midlayer on a future trip to give me a better margin for cold weather.

## Lessons Learnt

I packed very calorie dense food, I had 9,000 calories which weighed 2.1kg. I was worried about eating my food too quickly, which caused the opposite problem I finished my hike with food leftover, in the future I will ration out my food.

I didn't carry much water as there were ample places to fill up, this worked very well and helped reduce the weight I carried. I experimented with  homemade shoulder mounted water bottle straps, the weight balance and easy access was nice but the straps themselves need work as the bottles occasionally dropped out.

My feet were wet for a lot of the time, this caused discomfort towards the end of the hike. Waterproof shoes (not boots) are a bad idea as they let water in but not out. I plan to move towards quick drying shoes in spring/summer and waterproof boots in autumn/winter. I should also put more effort into drying out my feet when I stop.
