My Christmas present this year was a Petzl e+LITE headtorch. My current headtorch is a Petzl Tikka Plus, the e+LITE isn't a full replacement for the Tikka, it doesn't have nearly the same max power or battery capacity. But during the summer when the daylight hours are long and I don't have any night hiking planned, it will be enough. It will also make a good backup in the winter.

The strap adjuster is also a small whistle. I've never really liked the idea of multi-purpose gear and preferred the "do one thing and do it well" philosophy. The whistle produces a 100dB sound, I think a more powerful 120dB is worth the 10 or so extra grams.

The total weight is 28 grams as advertised. This is broken down roughly to

* main torch 15g
* torch mount 5g
* whistle 2g
* strap 6g

The elastic strap is very stretchy and a bit large, so I removed the whistle and sewed the strap together. I found a strap size that fit both my head and my climbing helmet, so I was happy that I wouldn't be surrendering much functionality.

This modification cut 4 grams, not much really, but that's 14% of the original weight. It also makes the torch more compact and reduces the risk of mechanical failure. Most importantly, I enjoy modifying my gear.
