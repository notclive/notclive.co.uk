title: Fastpacking the Bob Graham Round

The Bob Graham Round is a circuit of 42 peaks in the UK's Lake District. Hardened fell runners attempt to complete the round in under 24 hours, those that succeed enter the prestigious ['Bob Graham 24 Hour Club'](http://www.bobgrahamclub.org.uk). The round is over 100km long with a knee shattering 8,000m of ascent.

I wanted to complete the round in a fastpacking style, self-supported, moving fast during the day, but stopping at night to camp. I allowed 3 days to complete the route but I aimed and succeeded in finishing the route in 48 hours.

I had a couple of goals for the trip:

* **Test myself and my gear setup ahead of my upcoming trip along the Cape Wrath Trail.** I've given myself just 7 days to complete the Cape Wrath Trail. I figure if I can complete the Bob Graham in 2 days, it's a good indicator I can reach Cape Wrath in 7.

* **Experience the Bob Graham route.** Running the round is a challenge I want to take on some day, I wanted an idea of how hard it would be, how much training and preparation would I need to complete it.

* **Get out for the first hike of 2019.** My last hike was in December, I needed to get back out there.

## Experiments
I like to make a few small changes to my setup on every hike, to try out some new equipment or ideas. 
You can [see everything I was carrying here](https://www.lighterpack.com/r/80z1hd).

#### Waist pack
I wanted to try hiking with a bum bag, or a fanny pack if you're American.
I hoped that by making more items and food accessible it would let me keep moving and help me cover longer distances. I'm converted and am now a card carrying member of the fanny pack club. I also recently started using a shoulder pocket for my water, this means I now only have to take my pack off to adjust layers, and never have to open the main compartment of my pack during the day.

#### Feed zone portables
I've been making snacks from the [Feed Zone Portables cookbook](https://amzn.to/2Js98M8).

For this trip I made:
* nutter butter cookies
* banana and walnut sticky bites
* black bean and mole pies
* french toast muffins

The results were mixed, the muffins and sticky bites were great, tasty and easy to eat, but the dough for the cookies and pies came out very dry.

#### No gaiters
I like to try ditching an item every once in a while just to see if I really need it.
I didn't bring any gaiters on this trip, and while it wasn't terrible, I did get a lot of scree in my shoes. I stopped to empty my shoes a few times, wasting time.

#### Salomon Quicklaces
I swapped my regular laces for [Salomon Quicklaces](https://amzn.to/2Vn17Q3). These were nice, they didn't slip and let me quickly make small adjustments to my laces. This made me more inclined to make adjustments instead of ignoring problems with my feet. The caps didn't stay together, I've replaced the caps with a double fisherman's knot and some shrink wrap.

#### Garmin OS Grid Reference Widget
I tried [a widget for my Garmin watch](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/10473162-3729-40e9-9a72-b7c16528c758) that gives my current OS grid reference. This was great to quickly confirm that I was at the right summit or on the right track. Much quicker than opening a GPS app on my phone.

## Sleep
I was exhausted after the trip and I feel like I'm still recovering 4 days later. I don't know how much of this exhaustion to attribute to lack of sleep and how much to attribute to the physical effort. 

I had a very bad night's sleep on the first night due to the cold wind. My shelter is a Zpacks Hexamid which is a bit exposed for the windy conditions in the UK, I also pitched it in what turned out to be an exposed spot. The very strong cold wind picked up about an hour after pitching my shelter. I should have gotten out and repitched my shelter lower to the ground, but the idea of leaving my sleeping bag in the cold was unbearable. This is a mistake I've made again and again, I often try and ignore a problem with my pitch, such as uneven ground, and hope I'll be able to sleep through it, instead of fixing the problem.

Overall I probably got 2 hours of sleep that night, which wasn't a good start to the trip. The next night I was very paranoid about the wind, I found a sheltered location and pitched much lower to the ground. The wind didn't affect me and I had a decent night's sleep.

## The Route
Overall the round is an amazing tour of the Lake District. 
My favourite sections were:
* Helvellyn ridge, it felt good to move quickly and tick off a number of peaks in succession
* Harrison Stickle and Pike Of Stickle, the little bits of scrambling on these peaks was fun, and I was just feeling good at this point
* Mosedale Horseshoe, some amazing landscapes and features like Steeple

The landscape may be pleasant, but the route is brutal. The quantity and steepness of the elevation is extraordinary. I often looked at an upcoming climb and thought "surely there's no route up that". My knees did suffer and were hurting from day 1, but they didn't get worse, and I haven't had any problems since the trip.

The weather was cold for the time of year, hovering just above 0Â°C. There was a strong cold wind, but very little precipitation and a good amount of sun. The lack of cloud made navigation easy, I barely needed my compass. Despite the easy navigation I still added some extra distance where I didn't know the most efficient route between peaks. Learning the route would be a must for a 24 hour attempt.

Some Bob Graham runners take a shortcut to Sca Fell up a crag called Broad Stand. I spent some time trying to find the route up, but ended up bailing and down-climbing. Not wanting to be a mountain rescue callout, I eventually gave up and walked around via Foxes Tarn.

## Conclusion
It was a great trip and I'm feeling positive about my upcoming trip along the Cape Wrath Trail. It's also made me more positive that I want to attempt the 24 hour round, but only after a lot of preparation and training.
